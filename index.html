                    whatever we do in one way or the other involves technologies, as technology has taken the world
                    entirely to a more advanced level. One thing i love specially about technology is that it make

                    I got to know that we have three types of CSS which are: in-line, internal and external.
                    In in-line CSS we add the css styling in the opening tag of our HTML elements as a style attribute.
                    while in internal css, we add css using style tag within the HTML file inside of the head
                    element just right after the title tag. And in the extenal css an external file is used to define the
                    styling in this method for any HTML page. External css can be used by more than one HTML page.

                    I learnt about the types of css selector which are:
                    element selector, ID selector,class selector, class attribute selector.We were also taught
                    the basic CSS and cascade hierarchy.

                    Padding is used to create space around an element's content inside of any defined borders.
                    while margins, are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined border. And
                    border property specifies what kind of border to display, it allows you to specify the style, width and
                    color
                    of an element border.
